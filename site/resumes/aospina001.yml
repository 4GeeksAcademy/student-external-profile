    summary: |
      Presently, I am learning coding to begin my career as a Full Stack 
      Developer. Professionally, I have worked in the banking industry for 
      nearly 20 years. Currently I am a Senior Credit Analyst, where I 
      underwrite Commercial Credit requests for clients. Through my banking 
      career, I have worked in Commercial Banking Sales, Portfolio Management, 
      Credit Services, and Collections. I have also obtained a license to sell 
      real estate, which I do part-time on the side, primarily for close 
      friends and family.

      In addition to pursuing a Full Stack Developer diploma, I am also 
      currently taking upper level accounting classes to meet Florida 
      requirements to be eligible to take the CPA exam.
