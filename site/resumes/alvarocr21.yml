  summary: "I think the best way to impress is to speak your truth. 
      And the truth is that when I finished the university I was not prepared for the computer science career, i
      t took 10 years to understand that you do not learn computer science in the classroom, you must like programming, 
      you must be passionate about programming, if you comply with this you do not need a title, you have something more valuable. Your brain."
